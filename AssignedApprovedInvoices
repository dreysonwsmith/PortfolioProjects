-- Create date: 1/12/2023
-- Description: Pulls reviewer information from both the AccountsPayableUnapprovedReviewer (reviewer) and AccountsPayableTableHeader (paid transactions) tables

--Updates:	--4/25/25 DWS - Changed left outer join to left hash join for AccountsPayableTableHeader to AccountsPayableTableLines for performance issues, added another AccountsPayableUnapprovedReviewer join looking at current approver to previous approver in order to create NewDateAssigned, and adding DaysAssigned
			--5/2/25 DWS - Adding HeadquartersMasterAudit table to look at records for Unapproved Reviewers on when they are first assigned an invoice and when it was reassigned (without being approved)
